A web browser enables users to navigate websites, while a web server hosts and delivers these sites to visitors.

1) Web browser
    A program designed for users to browse and interact with websites. 
    Commonly used browsers are Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. 
    Web browsers can store data like cookies, cache, and browsing history. 

2) Web server
    A server that stores and provides website content to visitors.
    Web servers accept requests from web browsers and respond with the requested content. 
    Common web servers include Apache and Microsoftâ€™s IIS (Internet Information Services). 

Web browsers and web servers communicate with each other using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
Entering a URL in a browser prompts the browser to send an HTTP request to the appropriate web server.
Although a single computer can act as both a web browser and a web server, these roles are typically performed separately.
