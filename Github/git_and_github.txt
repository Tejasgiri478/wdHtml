Q. WHAT IS GIT? 
A.  Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that helps developers collaborate on projects. 
    It's the most widely used VCS in the world and is considered the modern standard for software development. 
    
    Here are some of the features that make Git so popular: 
    
    Distributed
    Each developer maintains a local copy of the code repository, allowing them to work offline or remotely. 
    
    Branching and merging
    Git allows developers to create branches for specific tasks and later merge changes into the main branch 
    
    Pull request.
    These are tools that allow teams to review and approve code changes before merging them. 
    
    Snapshots
    Git captures a snapshot of your project with each commit, allowing you to revert to any previous version easily. 
    
    Performance
    Git is designed to be fast for committing changes, branching, merging, and comparing versions. 
    
    Support
    Git is supported by nearly every development environment and has command line tools for every major operating system
