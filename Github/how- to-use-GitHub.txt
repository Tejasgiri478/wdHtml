Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
    Visit GitHub and sign up for a free account by entering your details.
    Once you've registered, confirm your email to complete the setup.

Step 2: Install Git
    Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
    Once installed, configure Git with your name and email using these commands in your terminal.
    git config --global user.name "Your Name" (to set name)
    git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com" (to set email)

Step 3: Create a Repository
    A repository is a storage space where your project files and history are kept.
    On GitHub, click the "+" icon in the top-right corner, then click "New repository."
    Give your repository a name and choose whether you want it to be publicly accessible or private.
    You have the option to include a README file, which can serve as an initial description of your project.

Step 4: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
    Once the repository is created, you can copy it to your local machine by cloning it.
    In your repository on GitHub, click "Code" and copy the URL.
    Open your terminal, then run:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

Step 5: Make Changes and Commit
    Modify or add files in this directory as needed:
    git add .

    Once you've made your updates, the next step is to commit those changes:
    git commit -m "Changes description"

Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub
    After committing your changes, upload them to GitHub by running:
    git push origin main

Step 7: Pull the Latest Changes
    To synchronize your local repository with the latest updates, fetch the most recent changes from GitHub using:
    git pull origin main
