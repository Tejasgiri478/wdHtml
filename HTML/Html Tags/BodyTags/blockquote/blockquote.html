    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation" style="text-align: justify;">
        On 8 November 2016, the Government of India announced the demonetisation of all ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes of the
        Mahatma Gandhi Series. It also announced the issuance of new ₹500 and ₹2,000 banknotes in exchange for the
        demonetised banknotes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that this decision would curtail the shadow economy,
        increase cashless transactions and reduce the use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and
        terrorism.
