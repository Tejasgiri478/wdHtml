        The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the
        engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.

        Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889
        World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised by
        some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of
        France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[5] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in
        2022.[6] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[7] 6.91 million people
        ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.[8]

        The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[9] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest
        structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the
        Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title
        it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first
        structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a
        broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres
        (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after
        the Millau Viaduct.

        The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper
        platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the
        European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels. The climb
        from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second,
        making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually
        accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use.
        He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.

        Origin

        The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers
        working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable
        centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the
        French Revolution. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a
        great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top,
        joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[10] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he
        did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's
        architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the
        tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.[citation needed]
        First drawing of the Eiffel Tower by Maurice Koechlin including size comparison with other Parisian landmarks
        such as Notre Dame de Paris, the Statue of Liberty, and the Vendôme Column

        The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin,
        Nouguier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in
        the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Société des
        Ingénieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he
        finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise

        [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living,
        and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the
        Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[11]
